    The numbers 12, 63 and 119 have something in common related with their divisors and
    their prime factors, let's see it.

    Numbers PrimeFactorsSum(pfs)        DivisorsSum(ds)              Is ds divisible by pfs
    12         2 + 2 + 3 = 7         1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + 6 + 12 = 28            28 / 7 = 4,  Yes
    63         3 + 3 + 7 = 13        1 + 3 + 7 + 9 + 21 + 63 = 104         104 / 13 = 8, Yes
    119        7 + 17 = 24           1 + 7 + 17 + 119 = 144                144 / 24 = 6, Yes

    There is an obvius property you can see: the sum of the divisors of a number
    is divisible by the sum of its prime factors.

    We need the function ds_multof_pfs() that receives two arguments: nMin and nMax,
    as a lower and upper limit (inclusives), respectively, and outputs a sorted list
    with the numbers that fulfill the property described above.
    We represent the features of the described function:
    ds_multof_pfs(nMin, nMax) -----> [n1, n2, ....., nl] # nMin â‰¤ n1 < n2 < ..< nl â‰¤ nMax
