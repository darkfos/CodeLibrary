    A square of squares

    You like building blocks. You especially like building blocks
    that are squares. And what you even like more, is to arrange them into
    a square of square building blocks!

    However, sometimes, you can't arrange them into a square. Instead, you
    end up with an ordinary rectangle! Those blasted things! If you just
    had a way to know, whether you're currently working in vainâ€¦ Wait!
    That's it! You just have to check if your number of building blocks
    is a perfect square.
